# Trabalho_cpp

This repository contains two C++ object-oriented programming projects developed as part of my Computer Science studies at **IFC (Instituto Federal Catarinense)**.

## 📚 Projects

### 1. **Biblioteca (Library Management System)**
A comprehensive library management system featuring:
- User registration and authentication (admin and regular users)
- Book catalog management
- Loan and return operations
- Fine calculation for late returns
- User status verification and fine payment system
- Vector-based data storage (`std::vector`)

**Key Features:**
- Admin and regular user roles
- Login system with attempt limits
- Fine management (users with high fines cannot borrow books)
- Book availability checking
- Complete CRUD operations for users and books

**UML Diagram:** Includes class diagram design (`biblioteca.drawio`)

### 2. **eCommerce Platform**
A multi-user e-commerce system with:
- User management (buyers and sellers)
- Product and advertisement posting
- Shopping cart functionality
- Favorites list
- Purchase operations
- Admin controls (ban/unban users, remove listings)

**Key Features:**
- User authentication and role management
- Product catalog with categories
- Shopping cart and favorites
- Admin panel for moderation
- Transaction handling

**UML Diagram:** Includes class diagram design (`eCommerce.drawio`)

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Concepts Applied:** 
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - UML Design
  - Data Structures (vectors)
  - Class inheritance
  - Encapsulation and abstraction

## 📖 Academic Context
These projects were developed during my studies at **IFC (Instituto Federal Catarinense)** as part of the Computer Science curriculum, focusing on advanced C++ programming concepts and software design principles.

## 🚀 How to Run
Both projects include Visual Studio solution files (`.sln`):
- **Biblioteca:** Open `Biblioteca.sln`
- **eCommerce:** Navigate to `eCommerce/` folder and open `eCommerce.sln`

Build and run using Visual Studio or any compatible C++ compiler.
